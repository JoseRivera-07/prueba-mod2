# Resources Used
This project uses images extracted from Figma. Cloning the repository will open a folder containing the images used. The fonts were taken from Google Fonts. A base font called "Inter" was used, and various adaptations were applied to it for the titles, text, and buttons. The icons used were extracted as images.
